                  How to Apply These Terms to Forks

  If you develop a new program based on this source code, you have to
make sure that this license is included, allowing the source code and
application to be redistributed and changed under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    it under the terms of the addended GNU Affero General Public License as
    published by Stiftelsen The Unigrid Foundation and the Free Software
    Foundation, version 3 of the License (see COPYING and COPYING.addendum).

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero
    General Public License and the addendum for more details.

    You should have received an addended copy of the GNU Affero General Public
    License with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>
    and <https://github.com/unigridfoundation/hedgehog>.

  It is also important that you add information on how to contact you
by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

  It is your responsibility to make sure that you own the copyright and
patents of any source code that you contribute to this project.
